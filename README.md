# tensorflow-apis

I have created this repository to keep track of the various ways how to build and train models using TensorFlow.
TensorFlow has a very active community and new features are added frequently. On the other side the API is evolving
and 3rd party articles and postings that are maybe a couple of month old use methods and API that are already depricated.
